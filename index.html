        Gaming is the running of specialized applications known as electronic games or video games on game consoles like X-box and Playstation or on personal computers (in which case the activity is known as online gaming). In its most sophisticated form, a gaming interface can constitute a form of virtual reality.
        A video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device â€“ such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing devices, to generate visual feedback for a player.
